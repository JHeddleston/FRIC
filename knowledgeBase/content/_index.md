# FRIC Microscopy Core Knowledgebase

Welcome! You've found the Knowledgebase website for the FRIC Microscopy Core. This is where we publish resources and blog posts for users and researchers at the Cleveland Clinic Florida Research and Innovation Center. The [Tutorials] pages contain walkthroughs for the software in the core and startup procedures for all instruments. In the [Resources] pages, you will find sample code for image analysis, and useful articles/websites. The [Forms] page is a handy repository of safety forms and procedures as well as training modules necessary for instrument operation.

## Tutorials

The number of microscopes, visualization packages, and data analysis packages that are available for researchers to use can be overwhelming. Even in our own core at the FRIC, the possible applications for our instruments can present a significant challenge for novice microscope users. The [Tutorials] section provides useful guides for the various software packages at the FRIC as well as startup procedures for all instruments (although this information is also posted at the microscope as well). This information is a helpful reference after a user has received training in the core.

## Resources

The purpose of the microscopy core is not only to provide powerful tools for research, but also be a source of expertise for the FRIC. The [Resources] page provides helpful links to  peer-reviewed articles related to microscopy as well as code-base created at the FRIC that is open for use by anyone. It will also contain links to outside organizations that may serve as useful collaborators for particularly unique or challenging experimental questions. This section will be periodically updated as new articles or scripts become available.

## General

The [General] section describes the microscopy core staff and the instrumentation available for reservation. It also provides links to necessary sites for billing and reservation (iLab) and the CCF home page.
