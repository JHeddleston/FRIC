# Alphabet Soup(er-Resolution)
For many researchers, the prospects afforded by super-resolution (SR) imaging are both vast and exciting. The ability to visualize intact biological specimens at never-before-seen resolutions opens new pathways for elucidating a variety of biological processes, spanning infectious disease mechanisms, carcinogenesis, neurodegeneration, and endless more. But the dizzying array of acronyms reported in the literature, including PALM, STED, SIM, GSDIM, RESOLOFT, iPALM, dSTORM, among many others, can leave researchers unsure as to the optimal technique for their specific application(s). In order to help steer investigators in the right direction, this article will first provide a brief overview of the major classes of SR techniques, with suggested reading for further details. The second part of the article will outline a practical comparison of the two SR systems currently available at the Advanced Imaging Center (AIC).
